had recently been arrested for propositioning an undercover policeman in a Beverley Hills park and, according to the journalist who interviewed him, wanted to bravely reveal the truth "in his own words and in his own way."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Before taking the courageous decision to discuss his sexuality on TV, George said he calmed down by reassuring himself: "You’re a human being. Just go on TV and get it sorted."</p><p class=paragraph-text>The landmark interview with CNN starts with Jim Moret stating to George: "Your sexuality has been a focus of tremendous attention."</p><p class=paragraph-text>George responds: "Yeah, to some degree, with pop stars or film stars, we become the object of people’s self-definition, as well as the object of sexual definition."</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I think people like to think they can spot a gay person as opposed to a straight person because it makes them feel something … a little more defined in themselves.
