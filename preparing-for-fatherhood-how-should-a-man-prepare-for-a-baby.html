It will also make her feel more at ease and less stressed.</p><p class=align-left>If your partner is anxious, give her time to rest because she will need the energy to push during labour. Allow her to participate in activities of her choosing. For example, take her for a walk or watch a romantic film together. Ascertain that your companion is relaxed and not fatigued.</p><h3>2. Purchase enough baby items</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9f6641b8d4b45869.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cute gender reveal ideas: 5 ways to announce your child's gender</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Buying baby items is among the crucial things a father should do before a baby arrives.

In addition, you'll need to assemble extra components, such as an infant swing or changing tables, if you wish to utilize them.</p><h3>4.
