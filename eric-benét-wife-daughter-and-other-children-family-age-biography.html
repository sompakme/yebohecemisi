actor.&nbsp;The singer, who received four Grammy nominations for his work, is perhaps one of the best-known R&B singers today.&nbsp;His music is known to be loved by fans and critics alike, proving he is a complete artist.</span></p><p><span>As an actor, he appeared in several series and films, including&nbsp;</span><span>The Real Husbands of Hollywood, Half and Half&nbsp;</span><i><span>Trinity Goodheart</span></i><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Shine</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span>For Your Love.&nbsp;</span><span>Show that he has not just talent, but also versatility.</span></p><p><span>Over

band called Benét with his older sister Lisa and George Nash Jr – his cousin.&nbsp;The band released their debut album in 1992 and sold over 100,000 copies.</span></p><p><span>Just two years later, Eric re-emerged on the music scene as a solo artist and signed a record deal with Warner Bros.&nbsp;Records.&nbsp;In 1996 he released&nbsp;</span><span>True to Myself,</span><span>&nbsp;his first solo album with Warner Bros.&nbsp;Records.&nbsp;In 1999 he released&nbsp;</span><span>A Day in the Life</span><span>, his second album.&nbsp;This album featured “Spend My Life With You (ft. Chipmunk)”, one of his greatest singles.&nbsp;The song reached number one on the US Billboard R&B charts. It was also certified gold and nominated for “Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group” at the 2000 Grammy Award show.&nbsp;The album also won several accolades, including the Soul Train Music Award for “Best R&B/Soul Album, Male”.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Private life</span></strong></h3><p><span>The actor’s life was affected by several tragedies that affected him significantly.&nbsp;First he lost his father to cancer, then in 1993 his girlfriend – Tami Marie Stauff – died in a car accident.&nbsp;At the time of Tami’s death, she and Eric Benét already had a daughter together, India, born in 1991. For a time, Eric raised India as a single father.</span></p><h3><b><span>Net worth and career</span></b></h3><p><span>Eric Benét has a total net worth of $5 million.&nbsp;It is the result of many years of hard work and dedication.&nbsp;Her debut album featured several R&B hit songs including ‘Femininity’, ‘Let’s Stay Together’ and ‘Spiritual Thang’.&nbsp;Her second album was just as successful and included ‘Georgy Porgy’, which featured Faith Evans, and the previous ‘Spend My Life With You’, which featured Tamia.</span></p><p><span>Eric recorded another album in 2001,&nbsp;</span><span>Better and Better,</span><span>&nbsp;but Warner Bros refused to release the album because they wanted it to stay in the R&B genre. As a result, wanting more creative freedom, Eric changed label and released his next album,&nbsp;</span><span>Hurricane</span><span>&nbsp;which included the hit song “I Wanna Be Loved”.</span></p><p><span>His next album,&nbsp;</span><span>Loving Life</span><span>&nbsp;was released in 2008 and debuted at number eleven on the&nbsp;</span><i><span>Billboard</span></i><span>&nbsp;200.
