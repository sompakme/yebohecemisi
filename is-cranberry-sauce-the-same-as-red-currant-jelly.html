It is traditionally served with ice cream. The rise in popularity of American cuisine over the last century has resulted in redcurrant sauce being partially displaced as the condiment of choice by cranberry sauce as the condiment of choice.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Also, is it possible to substitute cranberry sauce for the redcurrant jelly?</h3><p>Instead of currant jelly, use Concord grape jelly or apple jelly in baking recipes where currant jelly is called for. You can also use seedless raspberry jelly or cranberry sauce in place of the jam.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, do you know if red currant and cranberry are the same thing?</h3><p>Redcurrant and cranberry are two different types of nouns. The first is a deciduous shrub, ribes rubrum, which is native to western Europe; the second is any of several cultivars of the shrub; and the third, as a noun, is a shrub belonging to the subgenus oxycoccus, which is part of the genus vaccinium, which contains four species.</p><p></p><h3>Taking this into consideration, what can be used in place of red currant jelly in a recipe?</h3><p>Red currant jelly can be substituted with grape or muscadine jelly if desired. Muscadine is a grape variety that is grown in California. As an alternative, three parts jelly and one part lemon juice might be combined together and used.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>When it comes to red currant jelly and black currant jelly, what is the distinction?</h3><p>The berry-producing shrubs known as blackcurrants and redcurrants are actually subspecies of the same plant.

The name is pronounced: KUR-uhnt. There are two distinct fruits known as currants: (1) the dried zante grape, which is similar to a raisin and is used in baked goods; and (2) a fresh little berry related to the gooseberry that is used in jams and jellies.
