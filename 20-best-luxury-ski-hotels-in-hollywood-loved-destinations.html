There’s also a rooftop pool and ski concierge perched right at the base of Ajax Mountain to help guests pop in and out of their boots. Topping off the newness are a fitness center and spa redesign at the hotel that opened this December, featuring three treatment suites (two of which have fireplaces and infrared saunas) and a partnership with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Seed to Skin Tuscany</a>, the cult-favorite, natural skincare line handmade at celebrity hideaway <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Borgo Santo Pietro</a> in Italy — the line is&nbsp;available both in the spa and as amenities in the guest rooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PRINT_rln_500_livingrm2_101667.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Industry executives also flock to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Gant</a> (from $1,330), the condominium resort now celebrating its 50th anniversary, and where Aspen Distillers is sponsoring the resident Rooftop Golden Globe alpine-studded igloo for one of the most desirable après ski scenes in town. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aspen Meadows Resort</a> (from $713), which plays host to Aspen Institute seminars, had a refresh as did <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Limelight Aspen</a> (from $685) where guests in need of post-shredding rejuvenation have complimentary access to their portfolio of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Therabody</a> recovery devices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Limelight-Aspen-Guest-Room.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in Colorado, Crested Butte is another emerging hot spot that Layne recommends to clients. “It’s lesser-known and great for a change of pace.” Biggs Bradley sees a lot of interest in Beaver Creek. “As other slopes have become busier, it’s very appealing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Heros-terminal-chairlift-sunrisePhotog_231025_63Craig-Turpin-Risingsunphotog.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Sun Valley</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While Aspen offers a glitzier ski scene, the vibe in Sun Valley, Idaho, is one of low-key quiet luxury that draws Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson and Demi Moore. This is also where moguls including Bob Iger, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates descend for the annual Allen & Company summit.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Sun Valley is such a gem,” says Embark Beyond luxury travel advisor Josh Geller. “East Coasters typically gloss over it in favor of Colorado and Utah ski resorts, however, the West Coasters are in on the secret. It has a wonderful old-world European charm and is surprisingly down to earth. The best part: fewer crowds!” Revered for being North America’s first destination ski resort since 1936, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sun Valley</a> boasts a flurry of enhancements at Warm Springs base on Bald Mountain (Baldy), including technologically advanced Flying Squirrel and Challenger chairlifts (expected to open mid-December), with Challenger reigning as the largest vertical rise in North America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SVR_SunValleyLodge_Scenic_BaldMountain_Aerial_Winter_2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sun Valley L</a>odge (from $519) is the preferred luxury hotel in town and is situated in walking distance to culinary and shopping delights at Sun Valley Village.

Netflix executive chairman and fervent snowboarder Reed Hastings recently invested in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Powder Mountain</a> where he owns a home. About an hour north of Salt Lake City, the ski spot is slated for numerous improvements such as steep terrain expansions, the forthcoming Launch Pad Yurt (an activity hub nestled at the top of the Village Chair) and strikingly low $19 a night skiing lift tickets.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Over in Park City — where the 60th season is being celebrated and a host of lift-accessible ski and snowboard terrain awaits —&nbsp;Red Pine Gondola at Canyons Village base has shiny new cabins with floor-to-ceiling windows for some of the best views of the surrounding Wasatch mountains. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Pendry</a> resort (from $845) is the newest five-star hotel and boasts the only rooftop pool in Park City.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Further up the hill in Deer Valley, an additional 3,700 acres of skiable terrain is on the way along with a new village as part of the previously announced Mayflower Mountain Resort project. And après-ski aficionados will appreciate The Royal, the 21-and-over reincarnation of Royal Street Café’s second floor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A mecca for posh accommodations, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stein Eriksen Lodge</a> (from $684) is dripping with European chalet charm and remains a forever industry go-to.&nbsp;“I love their residences, the service is outstanding, and they have one of the best brunches on the mountain,” adds Layne.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Another Hollywood favorite, the regal <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Montage Deer Valley</a> (from $1,350), just underwent an extensive renovation on their guestrooms and restaurants, including a new 16-course omakase experience at the property’s Yama Sushi, and is also home to the most decadent spa around.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Two of the newer, swankiest stays in the region are Auberge Resorts Collection’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Goldener Hirsch residences</a> (from $1,129) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Lodge at Blue Sky</a> (from $1,599 ); the latter is tucked away in Wanship, about 20 minutes from downtown Park City. In early December, Goldener Hirsch is launching a new après experience on the terrace outfitted with sheepskin rugs, outdoor fireplaces, a Bavarian pretzel cart and cocktails galore. Spa enthusiasts will rejoice over the debut of The Lodge at Blue Sky’s Edge Sanctuary where cold plunges, energy treatments and a Scandinavian sauna await. For those seeking refuge in a decked-out private mountain home, vacation rental platform <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vacasa</a> offers centrally located homes from $627 per night.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Whistler, Jackson Hole and Big Sky</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The ski destinations of Whistler, Canada, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Big Sky, Montana all have passionate fans.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In Whistler, “the fairytale castle-like charm of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Fairmont&nbsp;Chateau</a> (from $1,078) remains popular among many clients&nbsp;and recently had a nice renovation,” says Layne. Thrill-seekers are keen on the terrain in Canada. “The growth in popularity of skiers pushing the boundaries of the ski area limits is also on the rise, so we have a lot of members asking us to arrange for heli-skiing in remote mountains in Canada to reach the best snow,” says Laurent Baud, co-founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AMPM</a> travel and lifestyle service company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In Wyoming, Mandy Moore and Lindsey Vonn have been spotted at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Caldera House</a> (from $2,000), the posh eight-suite hotel and alpine club in Jackson Hole, where the winter season&nbsp;will be expanded through mid-April 2024.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The newest hotel in Big Sky, which is now celebrating its 50th anniversary, is <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Montage Big Sky</a> (from $1,067).

Further opulence is forthcoming with the arrival of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One&Only Moonlight Basin</a> resort, slated for winter 2024-25. For one of the most exclusive ski experiences, the elegant, all-inclusive <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Brush Creek Ranch</a> (from $2,147) in south-central Wyoming arranges for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">llama snowshoeing</a> and day trips to Green Mountain where only 18 guests at a time may swoosh in the sprawling 109 acres of pristine terrain.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Japan, Switzerland, Italy and Norway</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">If you’re yearning for a more far-flung ski adventure, Japan, Switzerland, Norway and Italy are a big draw.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Many of our clients are traveling much further distances for ski season this year,” says Tom Marchant of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Black Tomato</a>, a bespoke travel company. “Japan is very popular,” he adds. Biggs Bradley agrees. “We’re seeing lots of interest in Niseko, located on the northernmost island of Hokkaido, Japan. They’re known for epic powder, they’re on the Ikon Pass, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Aman</a> announced it’s opening there in a few years.” Geller is also seeing an uptick in Niseko bookings. “You get tremendous value compared to skiing at premiere resorts in the states when you factor in the cost of lodging, lift tickets, rental equipment and instructors over a peak weekend, it can cost around the same or even less to fly to Japan and ski Niseko versus an American resort,” he adds. “Plus, you get to stop for ramen heading down the mountain.” Layne’s go-to hotel is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Higashiyama Niseko Village, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve</a> (from $1,113).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Discover one of the most decadent, remote, off-piste experiences at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aurora Lodge</a> (from $20,000 per night, inclusive of all meals and activities) in Norway’s Lyngen Alps.

Over in swanky St. Moritz, the 39th <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Snow Polo World Cup</a> arrives Jan. 26-28. Designed with contemporary glamour, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grace St. Moritz</a>&nbsp;(from $520) is the area’s newest boutique hotel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">All eyes are on Cortina d’Ampezzo, which will host the Winter 2026 Olympics in the heart of the Dolomites in the Italian Alps. “This is where you’ll find some of the best skiing in the world,” says Marchant. In addition to the storied <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Rosa Alpina</a>,&nbsp;an&nbsp;Aman partner hotel that is currently undergoing renovations and will reopen for the 2024-25 season. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Hotel de Len</a> (from $580) opened in the last year and is adored for its location in the center of town.
