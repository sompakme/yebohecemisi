of MAFS scandal on OnlyFans</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Domenica Calarco is putting the “naked photo scandal” to bed once and for all – by releasing the intimate image used as a weapon against her.</p><p>The <i>MAFS</i> star was outed for running an OnlyFans account by her co-star Olivia Frazer during their stint on the reality show.</p><p>Despite the fact <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=eb43ec8f2a39fb3534d242cbdb78ef2d data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Olivia was widely condemned </a>over the move, Dom struggled in the aftermath of the incident.</p><p>She suffered <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=99c4a80f008c5d17c932b758e4df1563 data-tgev-label=lifestyle data-tgev-metric=ev>horrific abuse as a result of being “slut shamed”</a> and was later diagnosed with PTSD.</p><p>Now the 28-year-old is ready to turn the awful experience into a positive, telling news.com.au she is “taking back my power” by releasing the photo on her newly revived OnlyFans account.</p><p>“The issue has never been about the distribution of the photo, it was the damage Olivia intended to cause by sharing it,” Dom said.</p><p>“Releasing it is a very Domenica way of taking back my power by going, ‘You know what, you wanted the photo, here you go. But guess what, you’re gonna have to pay for it’.</p><p>“Everyone wanted to know what all this bulls**t was about – well you can see it for yourselves now.”</p><p>The professional make-up artist said she will be offering an array of other content to subscribers for a monthly fee – adding the “joke was on everyone whose shamed me” for using the platform before she appeared on the show.</p><p>“The main reason I did OnlyFans was because I was going through a divorce and I was out of work because of the pandemic and I didn’t want to rely on my parents,” she explained.</p><p>“I was too proud to ask for help, so I thought ‘OK, this is a way I can earn money in a pandemic.’</p><p>“I know some people will say, ‘well why didn’t you just go and get a job at Woolworths,’ but my mental health was unstable at that time because of everything going on.</p><p>“It paid my rent, I was able to buy a fridge and I made a good amount of money on there.”</p><p>Dom said most of her income was earned through paid one-on-one chats, stating she doesn’t understand “why there’s so much stigma around it”.</p><p>“We’re so behind here in Australia. It’s easy for people to turn their noses up and say, ‘oh you’re selling yourself’. I was earning a living,” she said.</p><p>Her revamped account will be “PG” she said, revealing she’ll be sharing everything from workouts to make-up.</p><p>“I enjoy sharing different parts of my life. Of course, there will still be some fun content on there that I am sure men will want to subscribe for, but it’s not going to be a place that is purely for adult content.”</p><p>Fans will also be able to communicate with Dom one-on-one as well for an additional fee.</p><p>“This is what my OnlyFans was in the first place, it is what I am comfortable with and I’m not doing anything I’ve not done before,” she explained.</p><p>“The joke is on everyone else because it was always there and it always has been. This is just me relaunching it after taking some time to think about where I want to take it.”</p><p>To celebrate the relaunch, Dom has recreated the photo as the original is too racy to publish on Instagram, posing naked on a bed with a cheeky expression on her face with her privates pixelated out.</p><p>Recently, Dom opened up about her<a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=90d386b153fa9d5f02d27ff5920a9e79 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev> treatment for PTSD </a>after appearing on the show in an episode of <i><a class=body-link href=# title=shows.acast.com>Sit With Us</a></i> – her podcast with MAFS bestie Ella Ding, 27.</p><p>Describing how she feels “scared” when she sees a photo of Olivia, she explained the reaction was diagnosed by a medical professional as a response to trauma.</p><p>“I actually get scared when I see a photo of her … It brings back PTSD of her sitting across from me.</p><p>“Like legitimately, for a while there after MAFS, sitting at any table that was like a dinner table or a table where I had to have a conversation, I’d legitimately freak out, ’cause I’d be like ‘Who’s going to start sh*t, who’s going to say something,’” she said.</p><p>“I fully had PTSD, my therapist fully says I’m going through PTSD, so it’s real.”</p><p>She’s now hoping to use her platform to help others, explaining her and Ella are hoping to get a consent advocate on the podcast to help others.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“We need to talk about this as so many people are so uneducated and don’t actually know what the laws are,” she told news.com.au.</p><p>“But it is a very predominate issue with the rise of social media and I just want to make sure no one else suffers like I did.”</p><p>A new issue of the podcast dropped titled, <i><a class=body-link href=# title=podcasts.apple.com>Putting OnlyFans to Bed (Part 2)</a></i> - drops on Thursday where Dom says she will end the conversation around the naked image that has haunted her once and for all.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3b1d68405f31bf556da974a2ed726639 width=1280 height=720 alt="MAFS star launches collection with Showpo" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z7w6iknqaZmK5ur8ClmKubn2K%2FprjEmqqeq12jwqWxjKylmqhdlsFur8Snq6udXaSzbrnAn6pmq5OWu6Wty2ilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZp1ukZaEp36Sb29qb2KZhnJ%2BlmmYnJpjZYR2gJicaHKe</p></div><div id=links><a href=./former-wcw-wrestler-ice-train-sadly-passes-away-at-age-56.html>&#171;&nbsp;Former WCW Wrestler Ice Train Sadly Passes Away at Age 56</a>
