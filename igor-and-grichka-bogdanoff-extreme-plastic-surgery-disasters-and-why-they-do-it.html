minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone last year.</p><p>This compares with 13 million in 2011, and the top five procedures were breast augmentation followed by liposuction, eyelid surgery, nose reshaping and facelifts.</p><p>The top five nonsurgical procedures were Botox (7.7m procedures), hyaluronic acid or soft tissue fillers, chemical peels, laser hair removal and photo rejuvenation (IPL).</p><p>The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery's plastic surgery predictions for 2020, released before the COVID-19 pandemic back in January, was it

most effective, most natural, most long-lasting and overall most cost-effective treatment for facial ageing remains a well performed cheek and necklift," the ASAPS report said.</p><p>It also foreshadowed a continuing increase in facial procedures by men, and the rise of "Baby Botox", targeted micro injections of a neurotoxin to achieve a more natural, subtle look.</p><p>"Generation Z, people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s will seek out aesthetic procedures earlier in life as a preventive measure and in non-surgical ways," ASAPS said.</p><p>Some plastic surgeons are willing

WebMD that initially it is hard to recognise a burgeoning plastic surgery addict.</p><p>"Sometimes you start working with someone who is reasonable, and the more you work with them, you begin to

and hostility, lower self esteem and higher levels of perfectionism, higher frequencies of childhood abuse and neglect and more frequent suicidal ideation and attempts.</p><p>The Sansone's paper, Cosmetic Surgery and Psychological Issues, published in Psychiatry MMC compared patients without BDD seeking cosmetic surgery to those with the disorder.</p><p>Those with BDD also had significantly
