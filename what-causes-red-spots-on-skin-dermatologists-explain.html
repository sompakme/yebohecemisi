After cleansing your face in the evening, apply a thin layer of the mask over your breakouts or acne-prone areas before bed. If you’ve never used benzoyl peroxide before, introduce it to your routine once every three days before using it nightly. “Just be sure you sleep on a white pillowcase, since the formula can bleach your fabrics,” he warns.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>dermatologist-approved; popular among customers; doesn't over-dry skin</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>bleaches fabrics</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"Great to use as a strong face wash in the shower or as a masque while I'm shaving or doing a conditioning treatment in my hair.

It banishes pimples in record time and is super lightweight, so I can easily incorporate it into my normal skincare routine. Personally, I like using it on dry, freshly cleansed skin as a spot treatment in my problem areas, after which I apply my normal serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen so that it doesn’t dry me out too much (and because sunscreen is essential!). It’s perfect for all skin types, but it’s drying (in order to dry out the pimples), so refrain from using it on cracked or too-dry skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>editor-approved; works quickly; also helps with anti-aging</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>can be drying</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I absolutely love this product.

They are usually the size of any freckle you might have already on your body, but they can be bigger. They don't cause any itching or irritation, but they can bleed if scratched, rubbed too hard, or cut open.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a plethora of online tutorials on how to diminish the appearance of these, but self-diagnosing and self-treating, especially via the internet, is never a good idea. Instead, see your dermatologist, who can treat cherry angiomas via laser treatment or electrodesiccation, which is an in-office preventative skin cancer treatment that involves scraping the skin's surface.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-cause-3-keratosis-pilaris><span>Cause #3: Keratosis Pilaris</span></h2><p>As many as&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1070651-overview referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>40 percent</a> of adults are affected by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a15790985/best-keratosis-pilaris-treatments/>keratosis pilaris</a>, which consists on tiny, hard &nbsp;red bumps that usually appear on the backs of one's upper arms and thighs.

In general, they are caused by either skin trauma—like squeezing a pimple with too much force—or by excessive dilation of the blood vessels from taking hot showers to drinking alcohol. They usually are in a branch-like pattern or sometimes even just in a singular bright red prick. Luckily, though, they don't cause any pain.</p><p>There are no at-home treatments clinically proven to diminish the appearance of broken capillaries, but your dermatologist can do so with a laser at their office.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-cause-5-papular-eczema><span>Cause #5: Papular Eczema</span></h2><p>Papular eczema is caused by a damaged skin barrier, which leads to inflammation and dry, red, itchy bumps on the body. It's typically worse during cold and dry weather (read: when your skin is&nbsp;already&nbsp;dry and irritated) and is more common on sensitive skin.</p><p>“Eczema appears in red, scaly bumps and patches almost anywhere on the body, but it's most common inside the elbows," says Dr. Zeichner. It's also common on the hands and face—and it itches.</p><p>“The itch can cause a huge urge to scratch, but scratching will only make the rash worse,” says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/drrachelnazarian/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</a>, a board-certified dermatologist with the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.schweigerderm.com/rachel-nazarian-m-d/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Schweiger Dermatology Group</a>&nbsp;in New York City.

Burning and stinging is common, but—and this is a big distinction—rosacea doesn’t usually present with itching.</p><p>“The best way to treat rosacea is to keep the skin barrier in as good of shape as possible,” says Dr. Zeichner. This means opting for products that reduce irritation and actively protect your skin from the sun.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Shiseido Urban Environment Vita-Clear Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 with Vitamin C" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/shiseido-urban-environment-vita-clear-sunscreen-spf-42-P504986 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fshiseido-urban-environment-vita-clear-sunscreen-spf-42-P504986&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UsscZR35GUQphoc9JWhWEj-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Shiseido Urban Environment Vita-Clear Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 with Vitamin C</p><p>This is my all- time favorite sunscreen. First of all, its consistency is thin and easy to spread, and it never feels heavy or pore-clogging on my face. Because it dries matte, it’s also an excellent primer for makeup. It’s designed for people who, like me, live in urban environments with tons of pollutants that can damage the skin barrier, increase bacterial growth, or bring on visible signs of premature aging. It also contains SPF 42—one of the higher SPFs for facial sunscreens.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lightweight; editor-approved; good for all skin types; SPF 42</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>small container</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I don’t use makeup everyday, but I have to use sunscreen to anti-aging every day.

However, hydration is often key to getting rid of acne: When our skin is dehydrated, it overcompensates by speeding up production of sebum, an oil that’s meant to nourish our skin but that often clogs pores, resulting in acne. This oil from Katini Skin is made with acne-prone skin in mind, and moisturizes skin without making it feel heavy or clogging pores. It’s helped clear countless breakouts for me personally, and reviewers say the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>made from natural ingredients; editor-approved; dries matte; smells good; a little goes a long way</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>expensive</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I have been using this oil now for about a year. It is absolutely fabulous for your skin. I suffer from cystic acne and it really helps, along with my medications prescribed to me by my dermatologist." -Thirteen Lune</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvQex7k8pXdGTHb9q7ecXW-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Dr. Joshua Zeichner </span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology and an Associate Professor of Dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.<p>As the Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital's Department of Dermatology, Dr. Zeichner has a broad interest in medical and cosmetic dermatology as well as clinical research.
