His parents were: father Ora “Shack” Blocker and mother Mary Arizona Blocker (née Davis). Ora Blocker was a farmer, but after they were hit by The Great Depression and lost their farm, he moved his family to O'Donnell where he opened and ran a grocery store.</p><p class=align-left>Dan attended the Texas Military Institute and in 1946, began his undergraduate studies Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. While there, he played football and also performed in a school play. In 1950, he graduated with a degree in English. He went on to Boston where he did repertory work and eventually joined and served in the army and worked his way to the rank of Sergeant. He served in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">45th Oklahoma Division.</a></p><p class=align-left>After his time in the army, in 1952, he attended Sul Ross State Teacher's College in Alpine, Texas. While there, he earned a master's degree in Dramatic Arts. He then became a teacher and taught English and drama at a Sonora, Texas high school. Dan Blocker then moved Carlsbad, New Mexico, where he taught sixth grade. He chose to further his education, and thus, moved his family to California with a vision to pursue a PhD.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/18f7bcbc0aa7fda8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Carroll O'Connor bio: life and death of the award-winning actor</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before fully beginning his studies, he started acting.
