After their split he moved back to his BC hometown with his mother and younger sister, Aisleagh.&nbsp;</p><p id=eel_xXVhnT data-wc=42>"My parents getting divorced was obviously a very traumatic experience," said the young star, later. "I went from being a very well-off little kid to having a couple of rough years rebuilding. My mother did that. She and I are very close."</p><p id=eYTgk_bJT4 data-wc=62>It was his mum who introduced Joshua to the starry world of showbiz. At just seven-months-old he made his first on-screen appearance in the feature film <i>The Changeling</i>, on which his mother served as assistant director. Aged nine the budding talent was a stand-in on 1989's <i>The Fly II</i> and had appeared as an extra on several episodes of TV show <i>MacGyver</i>.</p><h2>His career</h2><p id=epU_dv6B8Ci data-wc=73>But it was two years later that Joshua really caught the acting bug, deciding this was where his future lay. His dream quickly started to take shape when he landed a series of high-profile TV commercials. And three years later he had his first proper movie role under his belt - the 1992 blockbuster hit <i>The Mighty Ducks</i>, during the filming of which he was mentored by the movie's lead man, Emilio Estevez.&nbsp;</p><p id=eozWMrmEn1w data-wc=49>"He was the one who taught me that if I had respect for my job if I showed up on time, if I showed respect to those who had come before me as well as to the crew behind the cameras I would have respect for myself," says Joshua.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVV8wCwBLW data-wc=62>"He taught me how to become an actor. I didn't know what the hell I was doing." After graduating from high school and a stint traveling in Europe he landed the part of teenage smart-mouth Pacey Witter in the hit TV series <i>Dawson's Creek</i>. Although already in his 20s when he landed the role, Joshua essentially grew up while shooting the series.&nbsp;</p><p id=exHdrMr1uFU data-wc=63>"I was broke when I started that show, and then I got to put my sister through college (and) paid my mortgage," he said. Not only did his financial situation improve, but his love life blossomed as well. In a case of life copying art, he enjoyed an off-screen romance with his <i>Dawson's Creek</i> co-star <a aria-label="Biography of Katie Holmes" class=hm-link href=#>Katie Holmes</a>, with whom he remains good friends.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYGmJYWbklC data-wc=70>Joshua's big-screen career was also heating up. In 1999, he starred alongside <a aria-label="Biography of Ryan Phillippe" class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Reese Witherspoon" class=hm-link href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> in the thriller <i>Cruel Intentions</i>, followed by <i>The Skulls</i> in 2000 and, two years later, <i>The Laramie Project</i>. He was getting in some experience of live theatre, too. In January 2005, after <i>Dawson's Creek</i> ended, he joined Patrick Stewart in a 12-week run of <i>A Life In The Theatre</i> at London's Apollo Theatre.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDvHdmvz5X4 data-wc=54>He returned to the big screen in the Robert Kennedy biopic <i>Bobby</i>, for which he was hand picked by his former mentor Emilio Estevez. And while attending a glitzy premiere for the flick in which he played one of the politician's idealistic campaign managers he admitted that he'd been star-struck by its star-studded cast.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7ObZY-d_bD data-wc=44>Seeing his name appearing alongside those of <a aria-label="Biography of Anthony Hopkins" class=hm-link href=#>Anthony Hopkins</a>, <a aria-label="Biography of Sharon Stone" class=hm-link href=#>Sharon Stone</a>, Helen Hunt and William H Macy, he couldn't resist sending the film's poster home to his mum. "That's a pretty good list to be on it was heart-warming to be there," he says.&nbsp;</p><h2>His personal life</h2><p id=eY7YAnhz8Dm data-wc=19>Joshua has found similar success in his love life, romancing <i>Copying Beethoven</i> model-turned-actress Diane Kruger between 2006 and 2016.</p><p id=exZqxnFIkh8 data-wc=40>He went on to marry Jodie Turner-Smith in 2019 after meeting the model and actress at Usher's 40th birthday bash the year prior. In April 2020, the couple went on to welcome their first child - a daughter called Janie.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYWQYb4Y1f data-wc=37>The actress filed for divorce from the Dawson's Creek alum in October 2023, citing "irreconcilable differences". Recent documents on TMZ suggest that Jodie seeks joint custody of their daughter, and that a prenuptial agreement is in place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9wbmBkt7C%2Fx66YZqKRmLi0u81o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lil-dicky-breaks-down-rap-s-best-basketball-players.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lil Dicky Breaks Down Rap's Best Basketball Players</a>
