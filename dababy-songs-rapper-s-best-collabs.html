Though he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">hit a few bumps</a>, his career is far from over. In 2019, DaBaby’s career really took off. He dropped his debut studio album, Baby on Baby, where the hit song “Suge” saw great success. Soon, he started working with some of the biggest names in Hip Hop. The Charlotte rapper has made songs with Lil Baby, Offset, Lil Yachty, Drake, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Roddy Ricch</a>,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> just to name</a> a few.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It’s no secret DaBaby was headed toward becoming the biggest thing in Hip Hop. From his songs to his videos to his freestyles, he separated himself from the other rappers in his class. It’s safe to say he has the respect of his peers with all the collaborations he has. Let’s look at some of DaBaby’s best song collaborations to date.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">11. “Levitating”- Dua Lipa ft. DaBaby (2020)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Many people would say DaBaby went pop after his song with Dua Lipa. Who knew he would sound this good on a production like this? It looks like Dua Lipa did, and it gave her a hit record. Hip Hop is popular music and has been for years now. It just makes sense for collaborations like these. DaBaby shows he has different flows in his arsenal, making it a bright spot in his catalog. This is one of DaBaby’s best collabs and songs.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">10.“Baby Sitter” ft. Offset (2019)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">DaBaby gets clever on “Baby Sitter.” The song is a play on his name and the word “babysitter.” A babysitter provides care to a child when the guardian is not present. For the track, DaBaby taps Offset for a verse. Offset takes advantage of this solo opportunity and holds his own. ”Baby Sitter” was the second single behind “Suge," giving the impression that club songs like these may be his signature sound.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">9. “Lonely” ft. Lil Wayne (2021)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It’s always good to see the young and old rappers collaborate. DaBaby taps Lil Wayne for their single, “Lonely.” The song did not appear on either artist's album, but the video is very creative. DaBaby directs the video for “Lonely” as he plays The Joker from the Batman franchise. It looks as if he is in an insane asylum with Lil Wayne. Both rappers make their lyrics come to life in this short single. “Lonely” may not be as popular, but it's one of DaBaby’s better songs.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">8. “Toes” ft. Lil Baby & Moneybagg Yo (2019)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After connecting on “Baby,” the Babys get together for “Toes.” They also bring Moneybagg Yo along, as he has worked with both artists before. Though the song has three artists, it’s a pretty quick song. All artists along with the chorus rapped by DaBaby finish in under 2:30. It seemed as if that was the theme for his sophomore project, Kirk, as most of the songs are under three minutes. This Lil Baby and Moneybagg Yo collaboration is one of the highlights of this album. Other guests included Kevin Gates, Nicki Minaj, Migos, Chance The Rapper, and Gucci Mane.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Cry Baby” seems like a part two to “Cash Shit.” This time, DaBaby raps the chorus and in his verse, he once again mentions his collaborator. In return, Megan mentions DaBaby’s government name, Jonathan. Their relationship on wax is reminiscent of Nicki Minaj and Drake. Both are flirty, open, and very sexual on this record. It’s safe to say both rappers are comfortable with each other. Just before this track, DaBaby tapped Megan Thee Stallion for “Nasty” with Ashanti. It’s just as raunchy as “Cry Baby.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">6. “Nasty” ft. Megan Thee Stallion & Ashanti (2020)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">DaBaby used a sample of Ashanti’s “Baby” to make “Nasty.” Even better, he taps the legendary R&B singer for a verse. The North Carolina rapper gets the best of both worlds on this track. You hear the raunchy and aggressive bars from Megan Thee Stallion. While Ashanti's verse gives off subtle but sexy. DaBaby is caught in the middle of this music threesome. Everyone gets a turn to deliver a satisfying song.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">5. “Baby”- Quality Control, Lil Baby & DaBaby (2019)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Surely, Quality Control would love to have both “Babys” on their roster. Well, at least they have one with Lil Baby being one of the faces of the label. DaBaby is featured on “Baby,” a track from the compilation album from<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Quality Control.</a> They both have similar names, but you can clearly mark out their differences. One thing’s for sure, though, they both can rap, and this made for a good record.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">4. “For The Night”- <a href=# class=text-word>Pop Smoke</a> ft. DaBaby & Lil Baby (2020)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“For the Night” ended up being a hit for Pop Smoke. The song was released on his posthumous album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon. DaBaby winds up on another song with Lil Baby after not being on the track initially. "For the Night” sounds like a record to drive at night as it has a smooth but upbeat sound. It’s a perfect record for the album’s title. With an album filled with standout features, “For the Night” arguably has the two best artists on it. Many believe this song was one of the best songs of 2020.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">3. “Under The Sun”- Dreamville, J.Cole, Lute, ft. DaBaby (2019)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Are there more J.Cole and DaBaby collaborations coming? After “Under The Sun,” many have wanted more from the two Carolina rappers. J. Cole is often regarded as an elite emcee. Therefore DaBaby had to come with his A-game. And he did just that as his verse was a standout off the Dreamville mixtape, Revenge of the Dreamers III. The “Suge” rapper proves he can stand next to the best of them.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">2. “Cash Shit”-Megan Thee Stallion ft. DaBaby (2019)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At one point, DaBaby and Megan Thee Stallion were the hottest acts in Hip Hop. Everything Megan touches seems to turn to gold, and at one point DaBaby could not miss on a record. They combine to make “Cash Shit,” their first song together, which comes off the Houston Hottie’s Fever mixtape. Many felt the song was one of the best songs to come out in 2019. In his verse, DaBaby gets clever and raps about a woman named Megan. He even calls her a stallion. The way DaBaby flirts with the “Hot Girl Summer” rapper makes you want more music from the two.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-1-rockstar-dababy-ft-roddy-ricch-2020>1. “Rockstar”- DaBaby ft. Roddy Ricch (2020)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Rockstar'' might be DaBaby’s biggest song to date. When he dropped this, he was one of the hottest rappers out. He also did himself a favor by collaborating with another young hot rapper, Roddy Ricch. This might have been the song that helped his career take an incline. It was his first No. 1 record. This record is special as it isn’t a typical Hip Hop record with rock and pop sounds. This is the first time DaBaby displays his versatility and creativity.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIJ1gpFmm5qakZfGbr%2FOp55mm5%2BhuaKu0g%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dan-blocker-bio-wife-son-net-worth-cause-of-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dan Blocker bio: wife, son, net worth, cause of death</a>
