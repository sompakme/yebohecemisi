This belief is called the doctrine of the Trinity: God the Father - the creator and sustainer of all things. God the Son - the incarnation of God as a human being, Jesus Christ, on Earth.</span></span><h2>Do Catholics and Christians believe in the same Trinity?</h2>Catholics worship the One and Only God, who is the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.) He is ONE God, in three divine Persons, and his name is YHWH or Yahweh. The second Person of this Trinity (the Son) came to earth and took on humanity.<h2>Which religion does not believe in the Trinity?</h2>Jehovah's Witnesses identify as Christians, but their beliefs are different from other Christians in some ways. For instance, they teach that Jesus is the son of God but is not part of a Trinity.<h2>What religions believe in the Holy Trinity?</h2>Trinity, in Christian doctrine, the unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. The doctrine of the Trinity is considered to be one of the central Christian affirmations about God.<h2>Do Catholics pray to Jesus?</h2>A number of prayers to Jesus Christ exist within the Roman Catholic tradition. These prayers have diverse origins and forms. Some were attributed to visions of saints, others were handed down by tradition.<h2>The Trinity | Catholic Central</h2><p></p><h2>Why do Catholics worship Mary instead of Jesus?</h2>The Catholic Church teaches that Mary is the Mother of God, that she is to be venerated as the Mother of God, and that she intercedes for us to secure our salvation. This is why Catholics love and respect her and pray to her as the Mother of God. Mary acts as the true mediator between God and humanity.<h2>Is it OK to pray to Mary?</h2>Should we refrain from doing that?” The simple answer to your question is “Yes, you should refrain from praying to Mary and to the saints.” Catholics pray to Mary (or to the saints) because, like the rest of us, they recognize their need for someone to help them bring their requests to a holy God.<h2>Does the Bible mention the Trinity?</h2>While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament contains a number of Trinitarian formulas, including Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14, 1 Corinthians 12:4–5, Ephesians 4:4–6, 1 Peter 1:2, and Revelation 1:4–5.<h2>Where did the idea of the Trinity come from?</h2>The word 'trinity' appears nowhere in the Bible; the concept was finalized at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE after years of debate. It was an attempt to articulate Christianity's belief in the oneness of God with their claims about Jesus and their experiences of the spirit.<h2>What do Catholics believe?</h2>Catholics share with other Christians a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ, the son of God made man who came to earth to redeem humanity's sins through His death and resurrection. They follow His teachings as set out in the New Testament and place their trust in God's promise of eternal life with Him.<h2>Why do Jehovah Witnesses reject the Trinity?</h2>Witnesses reject the Trinity doctrine, which they consider unscriptural. They view God as the Father, an invisible spirit "person" separate from the Son, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is described as God's "active force", rather than the third part of the Trinity.<h2>What does the Catholic Church say about the Trinity?</h2>266 "Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory ...<h2>Why do Catholics have Jesus on the cross?</h2>The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice—his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of humankind.<h2>What's the difference between Christians and Catholics?</h2>The main difference between a Catholic and a Christian is that a Christian is a follower and a believer of the teachings, and the life and death of Jesus Christ, while a Catholic is a believer and a follower of Catholicism, which is the most wide-ranging denomination of Christianity.<h2>Do Mormons believe in the Trinity?</h2>Do Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Believe in the Trinity? Like many Christians, we believe in God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. However, we don't believe in the traditional concept of the Trinity.<h2>Do all Christians believe in the Trinity?</h2>The core belief<p>There is One God, who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Other ways of referring to the Trinity are the Triune God and the Three-in-One. The Trinity is a controversial doctrine; many Christians admit they don't understand it, while many more Christians don't understand it but think they do.</p><h2>Do Baptists believe in the Trinity?</h2>We believe in one eternal God who is the Creator of all things. He exists in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He is totally loving and completely holy.<h2>When did the Trinity become doctrine?</h2>2.1 The Old Testament<p>No trinitarian doctrine is explicitly taught in the Old Testament. Sophisticated trinitarians grant this, holding that the doctrine was revealed by God only later, in New Testament times (c. 50–c. 100) and/or in the Patristic era (c.</p><h2>Is Jesus and the Holy Spirit the same?</h2>The theology of spirits is called pneumatology. The Holy Spirit is referred to as the Lord and Giver of Life in the Nicene creed. He is the Creator Spirit, present before the creation of the universe and through his power everything was made in Jesus Christ, by God the Father.<h2>Is rosary in the Bible?</h2>A: As you know the bible does "not" tell us to pray the Rosary because this form of prayer originated only during the middle ages. However, important elements of the Rosary are biblical and/or belong to the common Christian beliefs. Judge for yourself.<h2>Is praying to Mary idolatry?</h2>They point to statues of Mary in Catholic churches and Catholics praying the Hail Mary as indisputable evidence of idolatry, blasphemy or other heresies. But although many condemn Catholics' treatment of Mary as straying from biblical truths, the truth is Marian devotion is firmly rooted in biblical teachings.<h2>Where is purgatory in the Bible?</h2>Roman Catholic Christians who believe in purgatory interpret passages such as 2 Maccabees 12:41–46, 2 Timothy 1:18, Matthew 12:32, Luke 16:19–16:26, Luke 23:43, 1 Corinthians 3:11–3:15 and Hebrews 12:29 as support for prayer for purgatorial souls who are believed to be within an active interim state for the dead ...<h2>Do Catholics pray to saints?</h2>Catholic Church doctrine supports intercessory prayer to saints. This practice is an application of the Catholic doctrine of the Communion of Saints. Some of the early basis for this was the belief that martyrs passed immediately into the presence of God and could obtain graces and blessings for others.<h2>Why do Catholics believe in purgatory?</h2>The Catholic Church holds that "all who die in God's grace and friendship but still imperfectly purified" undergo a process of purification, which the Church calls purgatory, "so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven".<h2>Do Catholics pray to Mary?</h2>Catholics do not pray to Mary as if she were God. Prayer to Mary is memory of the great mysteries of our faith (Incarnation, Redemption through Christ in the rosary), praise to God for the wonderful things he has done in and through one of his creatures (Hail Mary) and intercession (second half of the Hail Mary).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZJyZpJ28rbXCrGSbnZyesrexjKKlZqyYmnq1vsinoK2x</p></div><div id=links><a href=./doug-kramer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>&#171;&nbsp;Doug Kramer Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
