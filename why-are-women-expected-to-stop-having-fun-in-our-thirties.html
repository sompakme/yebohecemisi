That was, until I read the comments section. Always a mistake, I know. But messages were rolling in to the tune of: "They're 30-year-old women, what's wrong with them?" and, "They really are too old for this. Grow up ladies." A third wrote: "34 years old. Surely this can't be her personality much longer?"</p><p id=e7FO05q8G0K data-wc=53>Did I miss the memo that at 30 we're supposed to stop laughing with our friends? Maybe the commenters were referring to the belief that the trio was gossiping and should have matured beyond that behaviour. But again, who wrote the rule that the day we turn 30 we have to become serious?</p><p id=eXVkTaeBI7G data-wc=28>I'd be inclined to say, it's the same online people that comment: "You're a mother!" anytime someone with children dares to post a photo of themself looking sexy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ac782186b1c-taylor-selena-giggling.jpg><p id=eN5fS82Qrqj data-wc=70>I'm 34 now, and when I get together with my friends, we giggle just as much as we did when we were eight, 16 and 28. Some of us are married, others have babies, my best friend is a doctor - and none of these facts mean that we suddenly became a giggle-free zone, so why are women expected to suddenly stop enjoying ourselves the day we leave our twenties?</p><p id=egqrdjPdIr7 data-wc=33>"It’s often suggested that there's something inherently laughable or cringe-worthy about older women simply enjoying themselves," says BACP registered integrative therapist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Abby Rawlinson</a> when I quizzed her on why women are so judged.</p><p id=ee8yoXYeJAH data-wc=59>"The focus on the age 30 is interesting to me," adds BACP registered <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">psychotherapist Lucy Myers</a>.

My partner spends a good portion of his free time gaming - and nobody tells him to grow up. And when men (read: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) are seen laughing and joking together at award shows, people praise their camaraderie and male friendship, so why is there this societal pressure for women to be mature in our thirties?</p><p id=eN9XvsoG1PI data-wc=55>"There’s a societal double standard," Abby says. "Men are often encouraged to keep the fun alive as they age, but for women there’s this weird expectation to become more subdued. And when women challenge the status quo and continue having a blast, it disrupts these ingrained ideas about what they should or shouldn’t be doing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72de9c94334f-gettyimages-1908171125.jpg><p id=epoYlOlCNkm data-wc=37><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Life coach Mhairi Todd</a> elaborates: "Our society is built around gender inequality. Women and girls are reminded constantly by (frankly outdated) societal norms that they are under a different sort of time pressure from their male counterparts.</p><p id=eZUQqbHHSKT data-wc=70>"As such there exists a belief that by 30, women should have ticked off various milestones: career, kids, marriage, house. The same pressure simply does not exist for men. Have you ever met a man in his late 30s and thought, 'Odd that he doesn't have kids'? Probably not. But maybe the thought has crossed your mind of a female acquaintance.

"Laughing reduces the stress hormone cortisol and releases ‘happy chemicals’ such as dopamine, oxytocin and endorphins into our systems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfb39bbaab9a-gettyimages-1775430516.jpg><p id=e6TQ-mC9ZOEr data-wc=66>"Oxytocin is also known as the bonding chemical and helps us feel connected to others in a powerful way.
