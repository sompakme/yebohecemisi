But, unlike the first festival in season two of the <a href=#>ABC</a> sitcom — where the wildly unqualified principal of Willard R. Abbott school pretended the name of the petition-signing effort stood for “A Very Abbott Festival” — this time around, she wastes no time professing her true intentions.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Of course it’s about Ava, what do you mean?” actress Janelle James, who portrays Ava in the <a href=#>Quinta Brunson</a> comedy, asks facetiously. “She just wants to have a party, charge at the door, take half. What’s the big deal?”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The big deal in the episode turns out to be Ava’s promise that <a href=#>Questlove</a> will perform at the festival, which none of the teachers believe after she failed to book R&B singer <a href=#>Jazmine Sullivan</a> the year prior. But in a surprising turn of events for everyone except the elementary school’s overconfident leader, the Grammy- and Academy Award-winning musician and filmmaker who hails from Philadelphia shows up and solidifies Ava’s former cool girl status in front of all of her colleagues.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Below, James chats with The Hollywood Reporter about Questlove’s guest appearance, tussling with “Ashley Banks,” aka <a href=#>Tatyana Ali</a>, in a prior episode this season, and how she thinks Ava will handle Janine’s return to Abbott after turning down her promotion at The District.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">***</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>I interviewed you during season one of Abbott when things were still pretty low key for you. What’s life like now? Can you walk down the street anymore?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">What’s life like? I do my makeup for Zooms now. I’ve learned that lesson. Can I walk down the street now? I can. Is it advisable? Sometimes not. I always want to give people a good experience with me, especially because I feel like celebrity is such a different thing now and if someone does have a bad experience with me, I’ll know it later on. So that really informs whether I go outside or not. Don’t go walking down the street if you aren’t trying to have a meet and greet or hear some stories about the grandma who was a teacher and the auntie who was a principal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Talk about how this week’s episode, “2 Ava 2 Fest,” came about. Did you have any input on the execution?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the second season, we had Ava Fest. So when I saw the title for this episode I was like, “Oh, we’re coming back with the second one. This is a yearly event,” which is very Ava. Even though the first one was a moderate success, she’s going to do it again. Now I am not in the writers room at all, so I found out just like everybody else when I got the script, and I like that. This is the first time in my life I’ve had one job. I’m used to doing two or three. So I’m staying out the way, minding my business and trusting the writers to bring the gold that they’ve been bringing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>A Questlove cameo was teased throughout the episode, and he eventually pops up in the final moments. What was it like working with him? Had you met him before?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I had met him before a couple times, just here and there. And we’ve spoken about music and stuff like that. He can talk about that forever. It was cool to see him. I think he and Quinta are actual friends. I’m never one to claim a celebrity as a friend unless I know their mama’s name or something like that. But we’re cordial and he killed his part.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I also like that this episode goes deeper into Ava lore and you find out a little bit more about her background. It’s like, duh, of course Ava was a fly girl back in the day. She knows people and she’s Philly famous. So when Questlove shows up, it’s like no big deal. She’s like, “What’s up Quest?” which is a gag at the teachers a little bit, who didn’t believe that she knew him. And to their credit, they shouldn’t believe her, because I didn’t get Ms. Sullivan last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171898_0786-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Did production actually try to get Jazmine Sullivan to do a guest appearance?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I have nothing to do with that. It’s all <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/abbott-elementary-season-3-premiere-quinta-brunson-cameos-guest-stars-1235818848/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Quinta’s acquisitions.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Do the castmembers ever throw out guest star suggestions?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I don’t throw out suggestions. I believe that when we throw out suggestions that’s almost a guarantee that that person won’t come, especially in an interview. I hate to do it because then people think I can get them on the show, and I cannot. I always say a super aspirational person. Like I’ve said <a href=#>Diana Ross</a> should play Ava’s mom, and that’s somebody that if we get her, she’s so big, it wouldn’t matter if I spoil it in advance. But Quinta does run my boyfriends by me. I think that’s cool. Any love interest or anyone Ava is going to show interest in, she runs a picture by me like, “You good?” “How much acting are you going to have to do for this one?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also, with guest stars, sometimes that can be corny, just pulling in people on a show. But it’s a testament to Quinta and our show that even our guest stars are very Philly coded. They’re from Philly. They have something to do with Philly. It’s not just this random guy. The characters are very well integrated.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Ava went toe to toe with her sorority sister nemesis Crystal, played by Tatyana Ali, in episode eight this season. What was it like working with her?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">First of all, how exciting. I walked in the makeup trailer and she’s sitting next to me and I’m geeking, like, “Yo, that’s Ashley Banks.” It was cool to play opposite her. In my mind I was like, “Wow, what is this? This is amazing.” And I told her this, too, she really made me step up. Because it’s hard for somebody to come into a show that’s already established, and she brought it. I was like “Oh, let me wake up, too.” It’s not that you get lazy, but we’re so used to the rhythms of our ensemble, so to have this new person come in and she’s bringing it, I was like, “Oh, OK!” It was a great experience for me to match with her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>We find out at the end of episode 10 that Janine is leaving the district and coming back to Abbott Elementary full time. How is Ava going to handle that news?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I think we all know at this point, Ava’s softening to Janine. She’s helping her out. She’s complimenting her in her own way. She’s not happy about it, but she’s like, “OK, all right. She’s a good teacher, whatever.” Also, people always say Ava’s the foil, but Janine is also the foil. They’re at two opposite ends of the spectrum. Ava is causing chaos, being self-involved. And Janine is causing chaos, being self-involved, but under the guise of helping the school. First season, Janine was a freaking mess. She was too sure of herself in a position that she had just started. It was like, “Girl, listen to the elders.” I’m interested to see when she comes back from the district, how her more sure of herself demeanor is and what kind of teacher she’ll be now that she’s had that experience. Because she did kill it over at the district and she’s a little more confident now. She’s got on that little bodycon this season. New little boots. I see her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Speaking of wardrobe, X (formerly Twitter) went crazy over the Harvard sweatshirt Ava wore with her name in jewels in the season three premiere, and she’s had a few other trending fashion moments. Have you been approached about a merch line?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">There was an Abbott Elementary JC Penny line for teachers. There were no Ava’s in there, ‘cuz she’s too fly for JC Penny. But it had a Janine and everybody else. I would love to do something with somebody. If they’re smart, they should hit me up, because there are people who are tracking what I’m wearing and when they put it up it sells out. If you remember the “Sick Day” episode in season two where I substituted for Janine and did my glam? That dress sold out. They redistributed it, and it sold out again. I’m like, “Why isn’t Ava/Janelle James out here doing a collab?” Also, Harvard is selling that shirt. I’m not getting a cut, and neither is Quinta, and it doesn’t have the bedazzle, which is what sells it. But they are selling that Ava shirt with a picture of me next to it, so that’s funny. So I’ve been to Harvard twice, if you think about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171898_0213-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>You’ve won an NAACP Image Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for your role, and received two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nom. What do those accolades mean to you particularly for this character, and is there a specific award you have your sights set on?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">They feel amazing. It’s not something I had thought about beforehand. I look at them as a testament that I’m doing a good job. I’m most thankful that I’m in a job that I enjoy. Who gets to do and say that? If awards come with it, that’s also good. That’s how I think about it. They’re actually right behind me, but ain’t nothing changed. I like to remember that so I don’t fixate on things that don’t matter. But I would love to win all of the awards while not being obsessed about it, because then it’s like, “Oh, you did such a great job you didn’t even have to ask for it.” People saw, and you deserved it, and here you are, and then I add it to the rest that I have. I just hope people see the work that I’m doing. I hope they acknowledge comedy and what an art form it is. It’s a hard thing to do. It’s a hard thing that Quinta’s doing.&nbsp;All these things that male comedians always think they’re doing, talking about social issues and things, we’re actually doing it but in a way that is very much still hilarious. I’m happy to be a part of it. If awards come with it? That’s cool. But I like money.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Abbott Elementary&nbsp;airs new episodes Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC&nbsp;and streams the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXZuyosDUq5ysZ5GXr7DA02acpZ2dmru1rdGyZKOZnpq5rbGMo5imnaNirretjKKlrZ2iq7amw4xqaWxtaGyDdoCQaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kate-middleton-s-favourite-pram-used-by-prince-george-princess-charlotte-and-prince-louis-revealed.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kate Middleton's favourite pram used by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis revealed</a>
