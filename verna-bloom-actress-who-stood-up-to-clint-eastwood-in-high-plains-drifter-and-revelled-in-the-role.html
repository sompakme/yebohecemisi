and as Dean Wormer’s hot-to-trot wife, Marion, in Animal House (1978), she flirted with Tim Matheson in the fresh produce aisle, schooling a generation of teens in the difference between “sensuous” and “sensual”.</p><p>Yet her career would be stymied by Hollywood’s attitude to ageing female performers. As she noted about Animal House: “It’s my first comedy role … I have friends who tell me I’m the funniest woman in the world, but never give me a comedy role.”</p><p>She was born Verna Frances Bloom on August 7 1938 in the small town of Lynn, Massachusetts, to a grocer, Milton Bloom, and his wife Sara (née Damsky).</p><p>She was a practical child who took over running the family shop after her parents’ divorce; later, she worked as a bookkeeper for a haulage firm.</p><span></span><p>She developed an interest in acting while studying at Boston’s School of the Fine Arts, and after training at New York’s Herbert Berghof Studio she eventually upped sticks to Denver, where she and her first husband, Richard Collier, founded the Trident Playhouse. She was a hands-on presence, treading the boards while manning the box office, running PR campaigns and even acting as janitor.</p><p>The multi-tasking was either too much, or not enough: by the mid-1960s, Verna Bloom had divorced Collier and relocated to New York, aiming to make it big on Broadway. Her big break came in 1967 when, as an understudy, she replaced an unwell Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday in the Martin Beck Theatre’s staging of Marat/Sade.</p><p>She booked her first television role in The Questions (1967), a one-hour drama in NBC’s Experiment in Television strand, then compiled multiple television credits, including an appearance on the long-running Western, Bonanza, in 1969. Around the same time, she met Jay Cocks, the film critic and Martin Scorsese associate, who was to become her husband for the rest of her life.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Verna Bloom in a scene from the film 'High Plains Drifter', 1973</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: &nbsp;Universal/Michael Ochs Archive/Getty Images</span></figure><p>Verna Bloom and Cocks were at the heart of an emerging cinematic counterculture (it was she who introduced Scorsese to Bob Dylan’s road manager Jonathan Taplin, producer of the director’s 1973 film Mean Streets).</p><p>Upon a recommendation from Studs Terkel, who had seen her triumph in the 1967 run of his Amazing Grace, Verna Bloom was cast in the epochal docudrama Medium Cool (1969), as the single mother thrust into the (terrifyingly real) tumult around the Democratic National Convention in Chicago; a balloting quirk saw her nominated for both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress by the National Society of Film Critics.</p><p>Thereafter, she filmed alongside Cocks and Harvey Keitel in Street Scenes (1970), Scorsese’s document of the growing Vietnam protest movement.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Verna Bloom in High Plains Drifter</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Universal/Getty Images</span></figure><p>Two striking roles in Westerns followed. In The Hired Hand (1971), Peter Fonda’s slightly undervalued directorial debut, she was haunting as a wife faced with the return of the husband who had abandoned her. In the Western High Plains Drifter she briefly appeared a match for Eastwood’s diabolically mysterious stranger, hissing: “I knew you were cruel, but I didn’t know how far you could go” before being manhandled into the bedroom.</p><p>Yet for all the impression she made, she was quickly returned to small-screen roles: as the mother of a troubled Linda Blair in the starry after-school special Sarah T. (1975), then in spots on Kojak (1976), Police Story (1976) and Lou Grant (1977).</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Verna Bloom as Mary in&nbsp;The Last Temptation of Christ</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Photo 12/Alamy&nbsp;</span></figure><p>As Marion Wormer, she flashed a mile-wide smile, impressing her young co-stars with her willingness to enter so gamely into Animal House’s hormonal free-for-all. Yet this notional comeback brought only fitful career progress. She reunited with Eastwood on Honkytonk Man (1982) and returned to Broadway in 1984 as Aunt Blanche in Brighton Beach Memoirs; Scorsesean loyalty saw her cast first as the sculptress plastering Griffin Dunne in After Hours (1985), then as a lived-in Virgin Mary in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).</p><p>Her remaining screen time was played out on television, with roles on The Equalizer (1988-89), Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993) and The West Wing (2003), as the stepmother of Allison Janney’s press secretary, CJ Cregg.</p><span></span><p>In later life she developed dementia. She was a devoted wife and mother, a keen animal lover, and an enthusiastic cheerleader for Animal House whenever it cropped up in the cultural conversation (her final screen credit came with a short film on the comedy’s 25th anniversary DVD release). Speaking to The New York Times, however, Cocks observed that the character his wife most identified with was The Hired Hand’s Hannah: “A very independent, strong, sensual, vulnerable, demanding woman … A lot of her was in that role.”</p><p>Verna Bloom is survived by her husband and a son.</p><p><strong>Verna Bloom, born August 7 1938, died January 9 2019</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnYmV%2BenuPa2ZpbV%2BrsrO6wGaZpaefonqir9OrnKyrXajBsLvDZpqloZ6peqat0q2uqKeUYrWqs8dmp6WZmaPAbrDRop2tnaJk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-negative-reinforcement-in-operant-conditioning.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is negative reinforcement in operant conditioning?</a>
