However, you should not let the fear win. Follow these 10 steps to find your purpose:</p><h3>1. Cultivate a positive attitude</h3><p class=align-left><a id=https://www.purposefairy.com/7515/7-tremendous-effects-of-having-a-positive-attitude/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Certain emotions</a> and behaviors that promote health and well-being can also foster a sense of purpose. Awe, gratitude, and generosity are three emotions that you should cultivate in your life.</p><p class=align-left>Studies have shown that the experience of awe makes us feel connected to something larger than ourselves, and therefore, it can provide the emotional foundation for a sense of purpose. Once you feel like you are a part of something big, you will be driven to make a positive impact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5c05c0d34807e459.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Thought provoking questions that will trigger your mind to think outside the box</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gratitude is equally important; those who are constantly counting their blessings are driven to contribute to the greater good. When you see how others are making the world a better place, you will be motivated to do the same. You will be generous and get a sense of fulfillment.</p><h3>2. Get rid of routine</h3><p class=align-left>The next time you ask yourself, “what do I do with my life,” make plans to travel and see the world. Any kind of travel that gets you away from your daily routine can help you to see where you should be going next.</p><p class=align-left>You do not need a big budget or a load of spare time. It could be a two day trip to somewhere you have always wanted to go. It could even just be a day trip to the beach.</p><p class=align-left>While you are away, do not force yourself to look for opportunities to find meaning or purpose. The value of travel is in the concept of a “<a id=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-a-pattern-interrupt-i_b_8075800 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pattern interrupt</a>.” According to this theory, when you do the same thing over and over, you get too comfortable to know what you need to change.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/72f36d71bf7d7ad1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to say I love you to your significant other - choosing the right time</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/779479cf25204b39.jpg><h3>3. Talk to people</h3><p class=align-left>Pick a few people you can reach and schedule a meeting. Without any expectations, go and interact with them. Find out what they are doing, how they do it but do not ask them for anything in return. Just have a normal conversation.</p><p class=align-left>You would be surprised by what you can learn, just listening to others talk. If you listen keenly, you will learn about people’s motivations, hopes, dreams, and ambitions.</p><p class=align-left>From this information, you will learn how others got to where they are today. You can choose to emulate them or pick a few bits and pieces to implement in your life. Either way, you will be a step closer to getting an answer for the next time you wonder, “what do I do with my life.”</p><h3>4. Find like-minded people</h3><p class=align-left>If you are having trouble remembering your purpose, take a look at the people around you. What do you have in common with them? What are they trying to be?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3cfbf44ea653710d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Am I in love? 20 signs that you love someone</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What impact do you see them having on the world? Is that impact a positive one? What do they need? Can you give it to them?</p><p class=align-left>If the answers to those questions do not inspire you, then you might need to find a new community, and with that, a new purpose may come.</p><h3>5. Dare to go big</h3><p class=align-left>One of the reasons people struggle to work out what to do with their lives is that they’re not willing to consider “big” options. It is easy to feel like big things are impossible to do or to come up with excuses.</p><p class=align-left>Because of that, you will convince yourself to think about it another time and that maybe next year you will be able to do it. And then another year comes, and then another…and nothing has changed.</p><p class=align-left>You should know that the people who have the happiest lives are those who have worked out how to stop putting off tough decisions and how to make a move when the time is right. If you are still thinking “what should I do?” then it is time to confront the big issues head-on.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2cb633921dba8378.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 lovely get well soon messages for those who need them</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/84c1f26c2759b54d.jpg><h3>6. Embrace discomfort</h3><p class=align-left>When you are out there pursuing your goals, you need to get out of your comfort zone. Learn how to make necessary adjustments.</p><p class=align-left>Do not give up only because it seems too hard or does not let you get eight hours of sleep. Do not hesitate to move to new surroundings because you will have to leave your friends and family behind.</p><p class=align-left>Stay focused on what you want to achieve and find a way of embracing the discomfort. In the end, your sacrifice will be worth it.</p><h3>7. Get ready for failure</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, we stop doing the things we love because we do not want to fail. We fear failure because it makes us unhappy, and we do not want to be miserable. So, we stay as we are and live an unfulfilling life.</p><p class=align-left>The truth is, worrying about not being good enough or failing at something can severely interfere with your ability to take risks. You need to realize that to succeed; you will probably fail along the way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/388add44acdbbd80.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting steps on how to get over a crush within a short time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do not hold yourself to others’ standards of success or failure. Set your standard. Set out into the unknown and take life as it comes, through the highs and lows.</p><h3>8. Have a flexible plan</h3><p class=align-left>Getting ready for failure does not mean that you should throw all caution to the wind. In any venture, you must always have a backup that mitigates the risk of something going wrong.</p><p class=align-left>After narrowing down your options and deciding what it is you want to do, have a sensible plan. Although you cannot predict all the challenges you will encounter, you can protect yourself from most of them.</p><p class=align-left>Because life is so unpredictable, your plan should be flexible. One of the reasons that people sometimes struggle is that they feel that once they have a plan, they should not deviate from it. You will meet people and have experiences that change your outlook.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f480d40b3d71bd7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 30 motivational scriptures and quotes to keep you on track</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Always review your plan and think about whether it is in line with your new vision. That way, you will have an answer each time you ask yourself, “do I know what to do with my life?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d8fbef2596b56b4.jpg><h3>9. Exercise</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Physical exercise</a> has been proven to improve emotional health. If you are struggling to find your purpose to the point where you are anxious and stressed, keeping fit is a step in the right direction.</p><p class=align-left>Even minor goals could also give you a sense of purpose. Have an aim to wake up the next morning and go on a run.</p><p class=align-left>The next day, purpose to get on the treadmill. If you do 50 push-ups the first day, set an aim to complete a 100 over the next few days.</p><p class=align-left>Motivate yourself to be active and work on your body. You should also include a healthy diet in your routine. Avoid having junk food and unhealthy snacks which contain fats, but rather indulge in fruits and vegetables.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/075ac8c41a487a3a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover these 30 best self-esteem messages and self-love quotes</span></p></a><h3>10. Enjoy the present</h3><p class=align-left>You cannot take over the future by constantly planning for it, but you can improve it greatly if you work on your present. Whenever you say to yourself, "I don’t know what to do right now,'' take some time to change your present.</p><p class=align-left>Look back at your past and remember all the things you wished for. Look at your present and see whether you have any of those things. If you do, enjoy them. If you do not, start working towards them.</p><p class=align-left>When worrying about the future, it is very easy to forget all the things you have worked hard to achieve. Always try to appreciate the moments in your life right now and enjoy them.</p><p class=align-left>Everyone has said, “I don’t know what I want to do with my life” at some point. This realization can cause a lot of anxiety and unhappiness. However, there are so many things you can do to realize your purpose in life. Improve your attitude, change your circle, and actively work towards your goals. In the end, you will figure out what you love doing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3ea64c5da19260c1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Appreciation messages to your friend</span></p></a><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR%2BkmpwbGWZYrGwutNmoGakmZuybrDEmqNmrJiewG%2B006aj</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jim-ovia-herbert-wigwe-tony-elumelu-others-top-list-of-richest-nigerian-bankers.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jim Ovia, Herbert Wigwe, Tony Elumelu, others top list of richest Nigerian bankers</a>
